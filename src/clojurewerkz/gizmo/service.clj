   You may specify `start`, `stop`, `config` and `alive` functions.

     * `start` is responsible for server start. It's called in a separate thread, that
      you can use for the service. It is usually a either long-running function that blocks
      thread execution and creates an internal endless loop, or fires up a timer or another
      control thread. Function receives `service` instance, that you can use
      to obtain and update service state. Stop function usually notifies `start` about
      the fact that service should be started in cooperative manner, through service
      state.

     * `alive` by default is checking wether the thread that `start` function ran in is
      still alive. You can override default behavior to provide custom service
      availability check. You can use service state in `start` and `stop` functions in
      to control execution flow.

     * `stop` controls stopping the service. Perform all operations to gracefully
      shutdown the service here, and stop the thread where service was initially
      executed. Make sure that stopping service shutdowns the thread it's been running in.

     * `config` function that retrieves configuration or configuration value that will
      be passed to `start` function when service starts.
